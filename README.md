## Introduction
Welcome to `myshell`, a simple command-line interpreter that mimics basic Unix shell functionality. This README serves as a guide for users to understand how to operate `myshell` effectively.

## Features
`myshell` supports the following internal commands:
1. `cd <directory>`: Change the current default directory to `<directory>`. If `<directory>` is not provided, it reports the current directory. An appropriate error is reported if `<directory>` does not exist. This command also updates the `PWD` environment variable.
2. `clr`: Clear the screen.
3. `dir <directory>`: List the contents of directory `<directory>`.
4. `environ`: List all the environment strings.
5. `echo <comment>`: Display `<comment>` on the display followed by a new line. Multiple spaces/tabs may be reduced to a single space.
6. `help`: Display the user manual using the more filter.
7. `pause`: Pause operation of the shell until 'Enter' is pressed.
8. `quit`: Quit the shell.
